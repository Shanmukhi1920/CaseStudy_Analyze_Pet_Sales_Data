Company Background

PetMind is a nationwide pet product retailer in the United States. With inflation hitting 41-year highs, the company is planning to reduce the cost of customer retention by improving brand loyalty. The first strategy is to launch a monthly pet box subscription in three months. The marketing team is preparing a list of popular products for the pet box subscription. The chief marketing officer wants to know whether the list should only include the products being purchased more than once.

Customer Questions

The marketing team would like to answer the following questions to help with the decision:

● How many products are being purchased more than once?

● Do the products being purchased again have better sales than others?

● What products are more likely to be purchased again for different types of pets?
